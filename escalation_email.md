**Subject:** Suspicious Powershell Detected – User JSmith  

We noticed an auto-launched PowerShell script on JSmith’s system.  
It’s running from an unusual path:  
`C:\Users\JSmith\Downloads\login.ps1`  

Initial signs suggest the script executed without user interaction.  
Requesting investigation and next steps from the SOC team.
